## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Causal Loop Simulation
**Goal**: Verify 12-month HTF investment simulation works

**Steps:**
1. Click AI assistant button
2. Type: `"Simulate $2M HTF investment over 12 months"`
3. Wait for AI to process (will call simulateCausalLoop tool)

**Expected Output:**
```
Running causal loop simulation for $2M HTF investment over 12 months...

üîÑ FEEDBACK LOOPS DETECTED:
1. HTF Investment ‚Üí Equity ‚Üë ‚Üí Attracts More Investment (reinforcing loop, +0.3 per month)
2. Equity ‚Üë ‚Üí Gentrification Risk ‚Üë (unintended consequence) (reinforcing loop, +0.1 per month)
3. Foreclosure Risk ‚Üì ‚Üí Price Stability ‚Üí Gent Risk ‚Üì (balancing loop, -0.2 per month)

üìä TIMELINE (key months):

Month 0 (Baseline):
‚Ä¢ Equity Score: [initial value]
‚Ä¢ Gentrification Risk: [initial value]
‚Ä¢ Foreclosure Risk: [initial value]

Month 6:
‚Ä¢ Equity Score: [+improvement]
‚Ä¢ Gentrification Risk: [slight change]
‚Ä¢ Foreclosure Risk: [reduction]

Month 12 (Final):
‚Ä¢ Equity Score: [final value] (+X points) ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Gentrification Risk: [final value] (change)
‚Ä¢ Foreclosure Risk: [final value] (-X points) ‚úÖ

üí° INSIGHTS:
- Investment effect strongest in first 6 months
- Foreclosure risk drops fastest (direct impact)
- [Additional insights from AI]
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Response includes 3 feedback loops
- ‚úÖ Timeline shows months 0, 3, 6, 12
- ‚úÖ All 3 metrics tracked (equity, gent risk, fore risk)
- ‚úÖ Total change calculations present

---

### Scenario 2: Spillover Effects Analysis
**Goal**: Verify neighbor impact calculations

**Steps:**
1. Type: `"Show spillover effects of $500K investment"`
2. AI should ask which block group or use top result
3. Confirm block group selection

**Expected Output:**
```
Spillover analysis for $500K investment...

üìç PRIMARY AREA:
Block Group [GEOID]
‚Ä¢ Equity Score Change: +X points
‚Ä¢ Gentrification Risk Change: -X points
‚Ä¢ Foreclosure Risk Change: -X points

üìç SPILLOVER TO NEIGHBORS:
1. Block Group [GEOID] - Equity +Y points (adjacent)
2. Block Group [GEOID] - Equity +Y points (adjacent)
3. Block Group [GEOID] - Equity +Y points (adjacent)
4. Block Group [GEOID] - Equity +Y points (adjacent)

üí° TOTAL IMPACT:
- [X] households in primary area
- [Y] households in spillover areas
- [Total] total residents impacted
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Primary area shows 100% effect
- ‚úÖ Neighbors show ~30% effect
- ‚úÖ Total households calculated

### Scenario 3: Do-Nothing Baseline
**Goal**: Show negative projection without intervention

**Steps:**
1. Type: `"What happens if we do nothing in high-risk areas?"`
2. AI should identify high-risk areas using findTopAreas
3. Run simulation with zero intervention

**Expected Output:**
```
Projecting natural dynamics WITHOUT intervention in [high-risk areas]...

üîÑ UNCHECKED FEEDBACK LOOPS:
1. Gentrification ‚Üí Foreclosures ‚Üí Displacement (accelerating spiral)
2. Low Equity ‚Üí Disinvestment ‚Üí Lower Equity (vicious cycle)

üìâ 12-MONTH PROJECTION (no intervention):
Month 0: Equity X, Gent Risk Y, Fore Risk Z
Month 12: Equity [lower], Gent Risk [higher], Fore Risk [higher]

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
- Area may cross into "high risk" territory (>70)
- Estimated [X] households at displacement risk
- Without intervention, equity continues declining

üí∞ ESTIMATED COST OF INACTION:
[Based on population and risk scores]
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Shows decline trajectory
- ‚úÖ Identifies vicious cycles
- ‚úÖ Warns about threshold crossings
- ‚úÖ Estimates household impact

### Scenario 4: Top Areas Query
**Goal**: Test basic data queries and map highlighting

**Steps:**
1. Type: `"What are the top 5 areas with worst foreclosure risk?"`
2. Watch for map highlighting

**Expected Output:**
```
Here are the 5 block groups with highest foreclosure risk:

1. Block Group [12-digit GEOID] - Foreclosure Risk: 87
   ‚Ä¢ Median Income: $28,400
   ‚Ä¢ Equity Score: 32
   [View on map]

2. Block Group [12-digit GEOID] - Foreclosure Risk: 82
   ‚Ä¢ Median Income: $31,200
   ‚Ä¢ Equity Score: 38
   [View on map]

[... 3 more areas ...]

These areas share common characteristics: low median income (<$35k),
high cost burden (>45%), and recent price volatility.
```

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ 5 areas listed with GEOIDs
- ‚úÖ Map highlights those 5 areas in red
- ‚úÖ Each area shows key metrics
- ‚úÖ AI provides context/insights

---

### Scenario 5: Area Comparison
**Goal**: Compare two block groups side-by-side

**Steps:**
1. First query top/bottom areas to get GEOIDs
2. Type: `"Compare block group [GEOID1] with [GEOID2]"`

**Expected Output:**
```
Comparing Block Group [GEOID1] with Block Group [GEOID2]:

BLOCK GROUP [GEOID1]:
‚Ä¢ Equity Score: X
‚Ä¢ Gentrification Risk: Y
‚Ä¢ Foreclosure Risk: Z
‚Ä¢ Median Income: $A
‚Ä¢ Population: B

BLOCK GROUP [GEOID2]:
‚Ä¢ Equity Score: X2

## Debugging Tips

### Issue: AI not calling tools
**Symptom**: AI responds with text but doesn't run simulations
**Fix**: Check that:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in .env.local
- Runtime is 'nodejs' not 'edge' in route.ts
- Tools array is defined before anthropic.messages.create()

### Issue: "Block group not found"
**Symptom**: Tool returns error for valid GEOID
**Fix**: Check that:
- bg_predictions.json exists in webapp/public/data/
- GEOID is 12 digits (e.g., 260650001001)
- Data loaded correctly in loadPredictions()

### Issue: Map not highlighting
**Symptom**: AI responds but map doesn't show red highlights
**Fix**: Check that:
- AI includes 12-digit GEOIDs in response text
- GEOID pattern regex matches (\b\d{12}\b)
- Map has bg-highlights layer
- highlightedAreas prop passed to map

### Issue: Simulation numbers seem wrong
**Symptom**: Results don't match expected values
**Fix**: Check that:
- Intervention amount is reasonable ($1M-$5M for HTF)
- Loop coefficients in ai-tools.ts are correct
- Decay function is applied (Math.exp(-month/6))
- All 3 feedback loops are included

---

## Console Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging
Add to webapp/app/api/chat/route.ts:

```typescript
console.log('Tool called:', toolName, toolInput)
console.log('Tool result:', result)
```

### Check Network Tab
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "chat"
4. Watch for POST requests to /api/chat
5. Check request/response payloads

### Test Tools Directly
Create webapp/app/api/test-tools/route.ts:

```typescript
import { simulateCausalLoop } from '@/lib/ai-tools'

export async function GET() {
  const testBG = {
    geoid: '260650001001',
    equity_score: 45.2,
    gentrification_risk: 68.5,
    foreclosure_risk: 62.0,
    median_income: 42000,
    median_price: 150000,
    population: 1200,
    // ... other fields
  }

  const result = simulateCausalLoop(testBG, {
    type: 'htf_investment',
    amount: 2000000,
    duration: 12
  })

  return Response.json(result)
}
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/api/test-tools to see raw output.

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Collect Feedback**: Ask stakeholders to try queries
2. **Calibrate Loops**: Adjust coefficients if results seem off
3. **Add Visualizations**: Timeline charts, loop diagrams
4. **Document Patterns**: Common query types, failure modes
5. **Monitor Usage**: Track most-used tools, average response times

## Getting Help

1. Check error messages in browser console
2. Review CAUSAL_LOOP_IMPLEMENTATION.md
3. Read MVP_BUILD_PLAN.md lines 1528-1743
4. Test with simple queries first (statistics, top areas)
5. Then test complex simulations

Good luck! üöÄ
